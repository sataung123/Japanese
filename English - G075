If .... would (unreal)

We can use if .... would when we are talking about situations that are not real and probably won't happen. 

We use the simple past in the if clause and would/could + verb in the main clause. The if clause can come at the beginning
or the end of the sentence. If it comes at the beginning, use a comma to seperate the clauses.

If I knew her, I would tell you who she is.
(I don't know her, so I can't tell you who she is)

I would buy it if I had the money.
(I can't buy it because I don't have the money)

If I had enough money, I'd buy a car.

Although we use the past tense and would, we are talking about the present or the future.

I'd call her right now if I had her number.
(present)

What would you do if you lost your job?

If I lost my job, I would travel around the world.
(future)

Remember when we use if ..., the verb be is always were. 

If I were rich, I would quit my job.

If he were smart, he would quit his job.
