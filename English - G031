Indirect questions

The form of indirect questions is similar to the form of reported questions:

Could you tell me where Studio 5 is?

We can use indirect questions to be polite or if we think the person we are asking may not know the answer to the question. 
We introduce the question with a polite phrase.

For yes/no questions, use if or whether to introduce the indirect question. 

Is this the correct gate for the train to NYC? 
Excuse me, can/could you tell me if/whether this is the correct gate for the train to NYC?

For the information questions, use the wh- words.

What time does the film finish? 
Do you know what time the film finishes?

What do you think about my idea?
I'd like to know what you think about my idea.

The word order in indirect question is a statement order, not question order.

Can you tell me if this is the road to the city?
NOT Can you tell me if is this the road to the city?

Do you know who the manager is here?
NOT Do you know who is the manager here?
