Invitations

We can use a range of expressions to accept or decline an invitation in a formal situation, such as at school or at work.

Accept
We'd love to attend your party.

I'd like to come, thank you.

We'd be delighted to be at your wedding.

Of course we'll be there. We wouldn't think of missing it.

Decline

Unfortunately, we are unable to make it.

I'm afraid I won't be able to come to your party.

We're sorry but we are not available on Friday.

I'm afraid we'll have to decline your kind offer.
