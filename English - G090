Yet/still

We can use yet with the present perfect or simple present when talking about something we expect to have happened or 
something that hasn't happened before now, but it may happen in the future.

We use yet in questions and negative statements. It comes at the end of sentence.

Has the package arrived yet?
Yes, it has. No, it hasn't. Not yet.

Is dinner ready yet?

Yes, it is. No, it isn't. Not yet.

We can use still with the present perfect or simple present when we are suprised that something has not finished or when we are describing 
a situation that continues to exit from past to present without change. 
We use still in affirmative and negative sentences and questions. It comes in the middle of the sentence.

He still hasn't finished the report.
