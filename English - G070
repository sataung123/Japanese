Reported speech

We use reported speech (or indirect speech) to report what someone has said. 
Because reported speech reports on something that was already said, we usually change the tense, pronouns, and the time words, 
such as tonight, last night, yesterday, etc.

The word that is optional in reported speech - you don't have to use it.

Some tense changes in reported speech;
simple present => simple past
present progessive => past progressive

will => would
