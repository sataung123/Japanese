Could/Should

The difference between Could and Should is that could is used to say about something 
or some action or event that is possible or has a great possibility of happening. 

In contrast, ‘should’ is used to say something that is the best to do or to say 
that someone ought to do something, and the person must do it. 

Riya could visit us on Saturday.
(It is a possibility. Riya may or may not visit the speaker on Saturday.)

Riya should visit us on Saturday.
(This is more like Riya has to visit them on Saturday, or she visiting on Saturday is a nice idea.)
