Reported speech

We use reported speech to show what someone has said, without repeating the exact words. 
It is also called indirect speech.

If you report what someone said and it is still true, the tense doesn't need to change.

The word that usually follows the reporting verb, but it's optional.

He is a very hard worker. 
(direct speech)

She said that he is a very hard worker.
(reported speech/indirect speech)
