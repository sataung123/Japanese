Adjective Clauses with why

We can use why to introduce adjective or relative clauses when talking about or asking for reasons.
We can often omit the reason in these sentences and questions.

The clause with why is the statement and not a question.

I can see the reason why he wants to leave.

He knows the reason why he didn't finish the report on time.

I have no idea why they didn't go to the party.

Do you understnad the reason why she didn't say anything?
