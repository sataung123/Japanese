Using will for decisions and offers

We can use will (or 'll) when we announce a sudden, unplanned decision to do something.

The phone is ringing. I'll answer it.

Can someone close the window? I'll close the window.

Similarly we use will (or 'll) to make an offer to do something for someone, again without planning.

I'll give him a call if you want.

I'll help you with those boxes. 

We'll show you the way.

If we are speaking about actions that were planned in advance, we use be going to.

I bought a nice sweater for my sister. I'm going to send it to her tomorrow.

His friends are coming next week. He's going to meet them at the airport.
