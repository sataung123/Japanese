Question words + infinite

We can use the question words (who, what, where, which, when, how) + an infinite (to + verb) to talk about possibilities 
or ask for information or help. The sentences have the same meaning as sentences with should or can/could

I wonder who to ask. 
(I wonder who I should ask)

Please tell us what to do.
(Please tell us what we should do)

I'm not sure when to leave.
(I'm not sure when I could leave)
