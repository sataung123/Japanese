If .... Will

We use will with if in sentences to talk about the possible results of a future action. 
The if- clause can come at the beginning or end of the sentence.

Use the present simple in the if- clause and the future tense with wil in the main clause.

If you take the train (future action), you'll be on time. (possible result)

If you don't take the train (negative future action), you'll be late. (possible result)

You'll be on time if you take the train. 

You'll be late if you don't take the train. 

What will you do if your're late?

I'll call them if I'm late.
