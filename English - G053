Reported Speech

We can use reported speech (also known as indirect speech) to explain what someone told or asked us.
We use tell/ask + object + present/past tense.

She told me she's unhappy.
He told me he's leaving.
I asked him if I was late.

Note that usually when reporting speech, we change the verb tense.
If the action is in the present tense, it changes to the past tense in the reported speech. 

I want some food. He told me he wanted some food.

However, when we are talking about a situation that is still true at the time it is reported, we don't need to change the original tense of the verb.

I'm quitting my job. She told me she is quitting her job.

We can also use reported speech with the infinite. 

He asked me to help him.
They told me to come to the office.

Remember to change the pronouns in the reported speech. 

"Bring me my report", he told me. He told me to bring him his report.
"Can I take you to dinner", she asked. She asked me if she could take me to dinner.
