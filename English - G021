Static Verbs Used in the Continuous Form

Some verbs describe a state (and are known as stative), and they aren't usually used in the continuous (or progressive) form. 
These verbs include know, believe, like, recognize, etc. 

These verbs are not used in the continuous form because the state lasts for a longer period of time, 
is not an action, and does not have a definite start or finish.

I like classical music. 
(NOT I'm liking classical music.)

I believe in you.
(NOT I'm believing in you.)

We can use some stative verbs like feel, look, hear, taste, think, and see in the continuous form when describing an action 
or where there is a clear beginning and end.

I feel good doing this. 
(sense/state)

I'm not feeling well.
(action with a clear beginning and end)

I hear a lot of noise.
(sense)

I'm hearing a lot of noise.
(action with a clear beginning and end)

(sense)

I'm seeing him tonight.
(action to meet someone with a clear beginning and end)

I think it's a good idea. 
(sense/state)

(action of trying to reach a decision with a clear beginning and end)
