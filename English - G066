Abstract Uncountable Nouns

We use abstract nouns to talk about things that we cannot see, touch, taste, feel, or hear - usually an idea or a quality. 
Common abstract nouns are:

Feelings : love, hate, anger, hope, courage

Qualities: beauty, honesty, pain

Ideas: justice, truth, culture, information

Areas: education, trasnportation, hospitality

Abstract nouns are also usually uncountable (we can't count them) and we can use them without an article (a, an, the) when we talk in general terms.

I still have hope.

We expect you to show some courage.

Infromation, and how we receive it, is changing.

It's important we all think about education.
