If ... were 

We use the structure if ... were to give someone personal advice - it tells the other person what you would do in the same situation.
We use the past tense because the situation is "unreal" - it is obviously impossible to be someone else - but the advice is about the present.
It's often used with would and sometimes with should. 

The clause with if ... were can start a sentence, or it can come after the main clause. If it comes first, you need a comma to seperate the clauses.
Remember: always use were in this structure. 
Do not use was.

What would you do if you were me.
