Expressing the future in time clauses

We can talk about the future and when something will happen using time words before, after, when, as soon as, until. 
The main clause is in the future tense. 
The time clause is in the present tense.
Do not use the future tense in the time clause.

I'll tell her when I see her. 
NOT I'll tell her when I'll see her.

The time clauses can come first or second in the sentence. 
When it comes first, use a comma to seperate the clauses.

As soon as she gets there, she will call.

I'll do it before I leave.

After I finish this work, I'll write to her.

He'll stay here until he finds another job.
