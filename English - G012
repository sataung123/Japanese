Present Perfect + Superlative

We use the present perfect tense with superlatives to compare things with our past experiences. 
When we use the superlative with the present perfect, we can use ever to compare past experiences.
Ever comes between have/has and the past participle.

He's the most interesting person I've met there.

What's the best concert you've been to?

Who's the most famous person you've ever met?

Who's the nicest person you've ever worked with?


Remember :

To form the superlative : the + adjective + -est OR the + most + adjective

the fastest car

the most beautiful view

To form the present perfect : have/has + past participle

I have been to Paris.

He has done his homework.
