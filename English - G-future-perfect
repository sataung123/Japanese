Future Perfect

The future perfect tense refers to a completed action in the future. 
When we use this tense we are projecting ourselves forward into the future and looking back at action 
that will be completed some time later on. 
It is most often used with a time expression.

I will have been here for six months on June 23rd.

By the time you read this I will have left.

You will have finished your report by this time next week.

Won't they have arrived by 5:00?

Will you have eaten when I pick you up?
