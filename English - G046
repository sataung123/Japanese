Phrasal Verbs

A phrasal verbs is a verb + a preposition, for example, take + off = take off
A phrasal verb is usually has different meaning from the verb alone: 

It's cold. You should take a sweater with you. 
It's warm. I'm going to take off my sweater.
(take off = remove)

Many phrasal verbs have an object: 

Please take off your shoes.
Let's turn up the music.
She looks after my children.

Some phrasal verbs are separable. This means that a noun can come between the verb and the preposition:

Please put your jacket on. Please put on your jacket.
Please turn on the TV. Please turn your TV on.
You can take off your jacket. You can take your jacket off.

But we always put pronoun objects. (e.g., it, him, them) between the verb and the preposition: 

Put it on. NOT Put on it.

Some phrasal verbs can't be seperated:

She looks after my children. NOT She looks my children after.
Please clean up the kitchen. NOT Please clean the kitchen up.
