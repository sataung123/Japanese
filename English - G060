Restrictive Relative Clauses: Omitting Relative Pronouns

Restrictive relative clauses give us more information about the person or the thing we describe.
We use relative pronouns who, which, and that to introduce relative clauses. 

In restrictive relative clauses, we use who, which, that in the subject position. 

who --> people 
which, that --> things

The girl who works here is my friend. 

The car that drove by was red.

The car which drove by was red.

In restrictive relative clauses, we use whom, that and which in the object position. 

whom --> people
which, that --> things

The girl whom I helped thanked me.

The book which I'm reading is interesting.

The book that I'm reading is interesting.

In common speech, people often misuse that for people in the subject position and who in the object position.

The girl that works here is my friend.

The girl who I helped thanked me.

In restrictive relative clauses we can often leave out the relative object pronoun (that, which, who, whom) especially in more informal language.
We cannot omit the relative pronoun when it is in the subject position.

The girl I helped thanked me.

The book I am reading is interesting.

The girl who works here is my friend. 
NOT The girl works here is my friend.
