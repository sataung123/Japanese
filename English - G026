Prefixes

We can use prefixes (short additions to the beginning of words) to change the meaning of some adjectives. 
These prefixes usually mean "not", for example, displeased = not pleased 

Prefix + Adjective

dis + honest, loyal, pleased 
un + happy, tidy, usual 
in + complete, correct, formal
im + patient, polite, possible
ir + replaceable, responsible
il + legal, literate, logical

We can add a prefix to an adjective that already contains a suffix: unmistakable, unhelpful, irreplaceable, inexpensive, indepedent

If the adjective begins with the sound /p/we often use im-, not in-, to make the negative form:
polite -> mpolite NOT inpolite
perfect -> imperfect NOT inperfect

We often use ir- before the sound /r/:
responsible -> irresponsible NOT inresponsible

However there are some exceptions where we sometimes use un- before the sound /r/:
reliable -> unreliable

We often use il- before the sound /l/:
logical -> illogical NOT inlogical
