Conditional Offer

We can use if.....will to make offers to someone based on a condition.

If you pay for lunch, I'll pay for dinner.
(The offer of paying for dinner has a condition - the person must pay for lunch)

The phrase in the if-clause is the condition. It is in the simple present.
The phrase in the main clause is offer. It is in the future tense. 
We can also use can to express the offer. 

I'll help you, if you help me.

If you don't say anything, I'll finish the report for you.

I won't tell the boss, if you fix it right now.

I can help you, if you need me.
