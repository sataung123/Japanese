Adverbs of certainty

We use adverbs such as possibly, probably, certainly, definitely, clearly, obviously to show how likely something is.

If you think something is very likely to happen, use probably, certainly, definitely, clearly, obviously. 

If you are not certain about something, use possibly. 

Adverbs of certainty usually come before the main verb. 

He definitely likes Dan Blaze's movie.

They clearly hate their boss.

Adverbs of certainty usually come after the auxiliary verb (such as am, is, are, was, were, will) and after the modals 
(such as can, might, may) in affirmative sentences. 

She is definitely in her office. 

She was obviously very suprised. 

She can probably finish the project by tomorrow.

They come before auxiliary verb in negative sentences. 

He probably won't be coming.

She obviously isn't here.

They definitely don't like their neighbors.

In questions, the adverbs come after the subject.

Will they definitely be there?

Is he definitely coming to the party?
