Present perfect

We use the present perfect tense to talk about actions that began in the past and continue to the present 
or actions that happen only a moment ago and still affect the present.

To create the present perfect, use have/has + past participle. Most verbs are regular 
so add -ed to the verb to create the past principle.

Some verbs are irregular.

be -been
buy - bought
come -come
do -done
go -gone
leave -left
make -made
see -seen
speak -spoken
write -written

We can use just to say something happened a moment ago.

He's just gone out too.

He just called.

The children have just come back.


We can use the already with the present perfect to show that something happened earlier than expected.

He has already arrived.

The match has already started.

Have you finished the report already?


We can also use the present perfect to talk about how many times an action happened up to the present time.

I've been late three times this week.

She's seen them five times.

I've written ten emails since lunch.

How many times have you call him?

I've called him five times with no reply.
