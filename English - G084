Past progressive + simple past

We can use the past progressive and simple past together to show that one shorter action (simple past) happened 
in the middle of a longer action (past progressive). We can link the two tenses using when.

I fell asleep at 10:00 pm. The phone rang at 11:00 am. I was sleeping when the phone rang. 
(sleeping = longer action, rang = shorter action that happened in the middle of the longer action)

I was eating dinner when the phone rang.

He was playing soccer when the rain started.

What were you doing when I called you?

I was playing video games when you called.
